# ChatBot ü§ñüí¨

Welcome to Azure-based ChatBot repository! This project utilizes Azure OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services, Azure AI Search to power a versatile and intelligent chatbot written in Python.

This is inspired from [Sample Chat App with AOAI](https://github.com/microsoft/sample-app-aoai-chatGPT) to get started from and is headless implementation with python APIs. I have tried it to make it more modular to better understand and test.

# Endpoints
As of now, it has following endpoints: <br> 
1.  **/conversation/azure/simple** <br>
This endpoint simply calls Azure Open AI with user question in the input message for conversation (supporting both streaming and non-streaming responses).

# Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è
I'll keep on adding more features and endpoints, possibly incorporating with many more different technologies, frequently along with simple and robust CI/CD delivery pipeline (Dev/LLM-Ops). <br><br>Stay tuned for more!
